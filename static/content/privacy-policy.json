Your User Content is posted on and transmitted to others at your own risk. The Company cannot control the actions of other users of the Services with whom you may choose to share your User Content. Therefore, we cannot and do not guarantee that your User Content will not be viewed by unauthorized persons.</p><br><p>(iv) Transaction Information. Information about any purchase or transactions made on the Services. This includes payment information, such as your credit or debit card number and other card information; other account and authentication information; and billing, shipping, and contact details.<br></p></li><br><li>Information We Collect Automatically.<br>We may use a variety of technologies to collect certain information about your equipment, browsing actions, and patterns whenever you interact with the Services, including:<p><br>(i) Activity Information. Details of your visits to our Services, including the types of content you view or engage with; the features you use; the actions you take; the people or accounts you interact with; the time, frequency, and duration of your activities; and other information about your use of and actions on the Services.</p><br><p>(ii) Equipment Information.

For example, such information may be used to enable the functionality or features of the Services that provide you with information about stores near you, or enable you to remotely order and pay for the Services. We may also use information about the location of the device you are using to help us understand how the Services and functionality are being used and to deliver more relevant advertising.</p><br><p>The gathering of this information may be used for maintaining the quality of the Services we provide, as well as providing overall general statistics related to the use of the Services. The technologies we use for this automatic data collection may include: </p><br><p>(i) Cookies. A cookie is a small data file stored on the hard drive of your computer either for only the duration of your visit on a website (\"session cookies\") or for a fixed period (\"persistent cookies\"). Cookies contain information that can later be read by a web server. We may use cookies to provide you with a more personal and interactive experience on the Services.</p><br><p>(ii) Web Beacons. Web beacons are small files that are embedded in webpages, applications, and emails (also known as \"clear gifs\", \"pixel tags\", \"web bugs\", and \"single-pixel gifs\"). Web beacons allow the Company, for example, to track who has visited those webpages or opened an email, to test the effectiveness of our marketing, and for other related website statistics.</p><br><p>(iii) JavaScripts. JavaScripts are code snippets embedded in various parts of websites and applications that facilitate a variety of operations including accelerating the refresh speed of certain functionality or monitoring usage of various online components.</p><br><p>(iv) Entity Tags. Entity Tags are HTTP code mechanisms that allow portions of websites to be stored or \"cached\" within your browser and validates these caches when the website is opened, accelerating website performance since the web server does not need to send a full response if the content has not changed.</p><br><p>(v) HTML5 Local Storage. HTML5 local storage allows data from websites to be stored or \"cached\" within your browser to store and retrieve data in HTML5 pages when the website is revisited.</p><br><p>(vi) Device Identifiers. Resettable device identifiers (also known as \"advertising identifiers\") are similar to cookies and are found on many mobile devices and tablets (for example, the \"Identifier for Advertisers\" or \"IDFA\" on Apple iOS devices and the \"Google Advertising ID\" on Android devices), and certain streaming media devices. Like cookies, resettable device identifiers are used to make online advertising more relevant.</p><br><p>This Policy does not cover the use of tracking technologies by third parties. The Services may contain links, content, advertising, or references to other websites by third parties, including advertisers, ad networks and servers, content providers, and application providers. These third parties may use cookies or other tracking technologies to collect information about you when you use the Services. The information they collect may be associated with your personal information or they may collect information about your online activities over time and across different websites. Please be aware that we do not control these third parties' tracking technologies or when and how they may be used.

We encourage you to read the privacy statements and terms and conditions of linked or referenced websites you enter. If you have any questions about an ad or other targeted content, you should contact the responsible provider directly. </p><br></li><li>Demographic Information.<br><p>We may collect demographic, statistical, or other aggregate information that is about you, but individually does not identify you. Some of this information may be derived from personal information, but it is not personal information and cannot be tied back to you. Examples of such aggregate information include gender, age, race, household income, and political affiliation.</p><br></li><li>Information from Other Sources.<br><p>We may receive information about you from other sources and add it to our account information.  We protect this information according to the practices described in this Policy, plus any additional restrictions imposed by the source of the data.
